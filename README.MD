# goBarber Back-end

goBarber is an application where barbers can offer their services to the public and clients can schedule appoints with their favorite barbers.

This repository contains the application's back-end and was developed during the Rocketseat's MERN stack Bootcamp.

# Technologies and Learning Outcomes

The back-end was developed with **NodeJS**, **Express**, and **Typescript**. It allowed me to have hands on experience with:

- RESTful APIs
- Routing
- Models
- Repositories
- Services
- Working with multiple databases (TypeORM)
  - PostgreSQL
  - MongoDB
  - Redis (for caching)
- Docker
- Authentication via JWT
- File Uploads
- Domain Driven Design (DDD)
- Email Services
- Debugging
- Testing with Jest
- Deployment
- CI/CD
